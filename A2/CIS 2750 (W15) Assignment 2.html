<br><br>

Key concepts: <i>Graphical user interfaces; system integration; simple
              compilation</i>.
</center>

<br><br>

Compilation is the process of reading a program written in one language 
(the <i>source language</i>) and translating it into an equivalent program
in another language (the <i>target language</i>).  The C compiler that we have
used in this course takes a program written in the C programming language, and
translates it into an assembly language suitable for use on the target
platform.
<p>
The parameter manager library implemented in assignment 1 was intended to
be highly generic for maximum reuse in a potentially wide variety of
applications.  Given a suitable source language, the parameter manager could
easily be adapted to serve as the parser for a compiler.  In this assignment
your task is to write an application that operates as a compiler, translating
a simplified input language into an executable Java program.  Additionally, you
will provide a graphical user interface to act as a development environment
for this compiler.
</p><p>
Read the following sections carefully to ensure that you know what is to be
done and what is to be handed in. There are many details that must be handled
correctly for you to receive full marks on this assignment; you should pay
attention to these details.   Your Makefile must correctly produce the program
required, and each function, type and program file must be correctly named and
must behave in the appropriate way. If the details aren't addressed
successfully you will lose marks.  Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#style">coding style guidelines</a> to provide
direction regarding the format of the code you write.  You are expected to
work independently on this assignment (please see notes on
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/outline.html#cheating">academic misconduct in computing</a> for
clarification if necessary).

<center><h3>Dialog Compiler</h3></center>

<p>
This assignment can be discussed in two parts: 1) the development environment
and compiler, and 2) the format of the input language and the requirements
associated with the Java applications it produces.<br><br><br>

</p><p>
</p><h3>The Application</h3>
<p>
You are to provide a graphical user interface which will serve as a simple
development environment for developing and compiling programs in the source
language.  This interface is to be written in Java, specifically making use
of the <tt>javax.swing</tt> library package for the GUI, and the Java Native
Interface (JNI) to permit the Java application to make use of the native C
library directly, and should look something like the following:
</p><p>
</p><center> <img src="./CIS 2750 (W15) Assignment 2_files/ide.png"> </center>
<p>
The editor consists of:
</p><ol>
<li> a menu bar, with menu options "File", "Compile", "Config" and "Help"
</li><li> a button bar, with graphic adorned buttons for performing common operations
</li><li> an editor area with scrollbars where text can be displayed and
     edited (i.e. the "config" files)<br>
</li><li> a status bar which indicates the current project being edited (the
     project is the name of the file(s) minus any extension---if the project
     is called <tt>foo</tt>, it is implicit that this consists of a
     source file called <tt>foo.config</tt>; the status bar should
     indicate if the project has unsaved modifications.
</li></ol>
<p>
The menus should contain the following options (in order);
</p><p>
</p><h4><u>File:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>New</b> - start a new project
     <ul>
     <li> if a project is currently opened, the user should be given the option
          to save it if is has been changed since it was open
     </li><li> if the current project is new, the user should be prompted for a name
          for the saved file(s) (you can assign a default if you like, but the
          user should still be prompted); note that the file associated with
	  the project should have a <tt>.config</tt> extension.
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Open</b> - open an existing project
     <ul>
     <li> if a project is currently opened, the user should be given the option
          to save it if is has been changed since it was open; note that the
	  file associated with the project should have a <tt>.config</tt>
	  extension.
     </li><li> if the current project is new, the user should be prompted for a name
          for the project (you can assign a default if you like, but the user
          should still be prompted)
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Save</b> - save current file
     <ul>
     <li> if the current project is new, the user should be prompted for a name
          for the project (you can assign a default if you like, but the user
          should still be prompted); note that the file associated with
	  the project should have a <tt>.config</tt> extension.
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Save As</b> - save current file with new name
     <ul>
     <li> identical to the Save option, however the user should be immediately
          provided with the dialog to save a project with a new name (keeping
	  in mind the <tt>.config</tt> extension).
     </li><li> if the project is already named, that name should be already loaded
          into the filename box
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Quit</b> - terminate the program
     <ul>
     <li> if a currently opened project is modified, the user should be prompted
          to save it
     </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h4><u>Compile:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Compile</b> - compile the currently loaded file
     <ul>
     <li> see language section below for discussion of the two files
          involved in compilation
     </li><li> the compiled application (the collection of .java source files that
          implements the dialog box) should be created in a subdirectory with
          the same name as the project (i.e. the <tt>.config</tt> file with no
	  extension) and the file containing the main method (i.e. the
	  application) should also have the same name as the project file,
	  with a <tt>.java</tt> extension; you can generate as many additional
	  files, according to whatever conventions you deem appropriate, as
	  may be necessary to realize a dialog application.
     </li><li> if the project is new and/or unsaved, the user should be prompted to
          save it, and give it a name, first (keep in mind the <tt>.config</tt>
	  extension); if there already exists a project by the same name as
	  that which would be created, a yes/no dialog box should be presented
	  asking if the file(s) should be overwritten
     </li><li> errors in compilation should be written to a separate pop-up text
          window with a scrollbar and a single "Dismiss" button that closes
          this window
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Compile and run</b> - identical to the "Compile" option, however
     on successful compilation the resulting Java application should be
     compiled and executed immediately (see "Config" menu for Java
     compiler settings)
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h4><u>Config:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Java Compiler</b> - specify the external Java compiler to be used
     when compiling the code your dialog compiler generates
     <ul>
     <li> the current setting should always be displayed as part of the menu
     </li><li> when editing this value, the user should be allowed to either enter
          a complete path to the compiler manually, or browse for the
          application on the file system.
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Compile options</b> - options to be used when compiling Java
     <ul>
     <li> the current setting should always be displayed as part of the menu
     </li><li> editing the compiler arguments should be free-form, and whatever the
          user specifies here should be used explicitly as options to the
          Java compiler when doing external compilation (i.e. allowing the
          user to set a classpath or other parameters that may be relevant
          to the project)
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Java Run-time</b> - specify the external Java runtime command to be
     used when running the code generated by the dialog compiler
     <ul>
     <li> the current setting should always be displayed as part of the menu
     </li><li> when editing this value, the user should be allowed to either enter
          a complete path to the JVM manually, or browse for the application
          on the file system.
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Run-time options</b> - options to be used when invoking the external
     JVM
     <ul>
     <li> the current setting should always be displayed as part of the menu
     </li><li> editing the jvm arguments should be free-form, and whatever the
          user specifies here should be used explicitly as options to the
          JVM when invoking the external run-time (i.e. allowing the
          user to set a classpath or other parameters that may be relevant
          to the execution of the code)
     </li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Working Directory</b> - build directory for emitted Java code
     <ul>
     <li> the current setting should always be displayed as part of the menu
     </li><li> this should have a default value of the current directory (.), and
          if edited by the user should be used in place of "." as the leading
          path to the location where the Java program, as described above, gets
          generated (i.e. if the "working directory" is set to <tt>foo/bar</tt>,
          and you are currently editing <tt>dialog.config</tt>, the compiled
          dialog would appear in <tt>foo/bar/dialog</tt> with the main class
          called "dialog" appearing in <tt>foo/bar/dialog/dialog.java</tt>;
          directories should be created if they do not exist.
     </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h4><u>Help:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Help</b> - this option should pop-up a dialog which contains the
                  information that you would normally include in your
                  <tt>README</tt> file, and any other documentation you feel
                  like providing for your program.
</li><li><b>About</b> - pops up a dialog with your submission information (name,
                   id, etc.) and a dismiss button that closes this window.
</li></ul>

All menu options (menu titles and options within menus) should be fully
keyboard accelerated - that is to say there should be keyboard shortcuts for
every menu and menu option.

<br><br><br>

<p>
</p><h4>File Dialogs</h4>
NOTE: you are required to provide file dialogs for various reasons - they
should provide the following basic functionality (varying only in title and
functionality depending on whether you are opening or saving a file).  Note
that I fully expect people to simply use an appropriately configured
<tt>JFileChooser</tt>, so the look, feel and functionality of this dialog
is largely determined for you---ensure it operates in a suitable fashion
given the nature of this application (i.e. it should support a File Format
option for the Dialogc projects, etc.)
<p>
</p><center> <img src="./CIS 2750 (W15) Assignment 2_files/filechooser.png"> </center>

<br><br>

<p>
</p><h3>The Language</h3>
<p>
</p><p>
The compiler you are to write will make use of the parameter manager library
you wrote in assignment 1 to parse the parameter-based language (specified
in the next section), and output Java code that implements the specified
dialog-like interface (see specifications in following sections).  Once
compiled, the resulting Java code should be able to be compiled and executed
immediately without modification, from within the GUI environment, or
otherwise.
</p><p>
An example of the look of an application produced by your compiler appears
below:
</p><p>
</p><center> <img src="./CIS 2750 (W15) Assignment 2_files/compiled.png"> </center>
<p></p>

<p>
Due to the nature of the input, two passes over the config file will be
required to accumulate all necessary information---this is due to declaring
both the fields, and the types of the fields, which are dependent on knowing
the field names which you won't know until afte the first parse.

</p><p>
The first pass will involve creating/initializing a ParameterManager to scan
for known parameters corresponding to the three major components of the
dialog (specifically the title, fields, and buttons).  Once we know the
names of the fields/buttons we're interested in, a second ParamaterManager
can be initialized specifically to get values associated with each of the
fields (types) and buttons (ActionListeners)

</p><p>
<b>NOTES:</b>
</p><ul>
<li> <i>If you followed my suggestion for A1 and the ParameterManager is
     implemented such that it ignores unregistered parameters that appear in
     the input, the above operation is already supported.</i></li>
<li> <i>If your ParameterManager was implemented such that it generates
     errors for unregistered parameters, you'll have to make accomodation to
     support the single file; my suggestion here is to modify your 
     <tt>parseFrom</tt> function to consider the "special" character sequence
     "#!#", occurring at the start of a line, as equivalent to EOF.  This
     allows you to have the two sets of values in the same file, albeit in a
     specific order---we choose "#!#" as that allows us to use a single set of
     test files regardless of implementation assuming we use "#" as the
     comment character (although you have to be careful checking for #!# at
     the start of the line before you assume it is a comment).</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
</p><h4>The .config file</h4>
<p>
The .config file will have the following format:<br>
</p><pre>    title = string;
    fields = list;
    buttons = list;

    #!#

    label1 = string;
    label2 = string;
    ...
    button1 = string;
    button2 = string;
    ...
</pre>

Where <i>labels</i> are strings provided in the <b>fields</b> parameter
elsewhere in the file, and <i>buttons</i> are the strings provided similarly
in the <b>buttons</b> parameter (see below).  Note that the special character
sequence separator would not be needed depending on your implementation
(however would cause no issues assuming we specify '#' as a comment character).
<p>
These fields have the following interpretation:
</p><ul>
<li> <tt>title</tt> is the desired name of the application
</li><li> <tt>fields</tt> is a list of text labels for the text entry fields in
     the application
</li><li> <tt>buttons</tt> is a list of text labels for the buttons in the
     application
</li><li> <tt>labels</tt> - a type, one of:
     <ul>
     <li> string
     </li><li> float
     </li><li> integer
     </li></ul>
     <i>You should validate that these values are expected, and track what this
     is for future reference, however we will not be making use of the types
     for these fields until assignment 4</i>
</li><li> <tt>buttons</tt> - the name of a Java class to be used as the 
     <tt>ActionListener</tt> for the button, when pressed
     <ul>
     <li> note that this code is expected to be <u>user provided</u>; you
          only need to concern yourself with generating the appropriate
          code to make use of the specified class as the button's
          ActionListener; it is assumed that the programmer will have
          provided an appropriate class, in the correct location (e.g. main
          build directory), to make compilation/execution possible.
     </li><li> in order for the user to be able to specify and define appropriate
          <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes to handle button clicks, we need to
	  specify the expected interface and names of the get/set methods
	  generated to allow <tt>ActionListener</tt> objects to interact with
	  the fields of the compiled dialog.  These are critically important
	  details---see "The Compiled Program" section below for additional
	  information.
     </li></ul>
</li></ul>

During compilation, you will need to use a parameter manager instance to parse
the <tt>title</tt>, <tt>fields</tt> and <tt>buttons</tt> parameters to obtain
the values you will need to process specific values for each field/button.
Based on the values provided to you in the initial pass, you will initialize a
second parameter manager to parse the labels obtaining additional information
you will need to generate the required Java code.

<p>
The compiler should provide, as output, a Java program that provides an
interface as illustrated above, making use of the <tt>javax.swing</tt> library
package for GUI components.

</p><p>
</p><h4>The Compiled Program</h4>
<p>
The Java program output by your compiler should have the following general
format (as depicted in the example above).  Note: as the format of the
compiled application has the same format, with the exception of text
field and button contents, you have enough information to generate the
complete application automatically):
</p><ul>
<li> The name of the application on the title bar
</li><li> An area of labeled text entry fields (assumed to be stacked vertically
     as in the example)
</li><li> An area of labeled buttons (assumed to be stacked horizontally as in
     the example)
</li><li> A text area labeled status, with a scroll bar, where output from the
     operation of the program can be displayed and reviewed.
</li></ul>
The class generated to implement the dialog <u>must</u>
provide the following methods (for use in user-provided classes attached to
the buttons):
<ul>
<li> get and set methods for all <i>fields</i> defined in the config file as
     follows: "get" + "DC" + field_name, and "set" + "DC" + field_name.  By
     way of example, a field called <i>LastName</i> should result in public
     <tt>getDCLastName</tt> and <tt>setDCLastName</tt> methods in the generated
     code for the top level Dialog class that allow the caller to obtain the
     value in the field and assign a new value to the field respectively.
     <i>The purpose of this is to 1) ensure the user writing the
     <tt>ActionListener</tt> has standardized functions to inquire of and
     manipulate fields in the generated dialog, and 2) to avoid potential
     name collisions with methods defined by library-provided classes.</i>
<p>
</p></li><li> "get" methods should return the contents of the associated field as a
     <tt>String</tt>.  "set" methods should accept a <tt>String</tt> as their
     argument, which is placed in the corresponding field unchanged.  Note: the
     only place where validation of the field contents occurs is when the
     relevant "get" method is invoked (although the contents of that field
     are returned as a <tt>String</tt>); the <tt>ActionListener</tt> is free
     to set illegal values in the fields by use of the "set" methods.
<p>
</p></li><li> a method: <tt>public void appendToStatusArea(String message);</tt> which
     will append the provided message string to the status area.
<p>
</p></li><li> A Java interface should be automatically generated (part of the compiled
     output) that specifically declares the <tt>get/set</tt> and
     <tt>appendToStatusArea</tt> methods described above, and the top level
     dialog class should be declared to implement this interface (which it
     does, having provided implementations for all the <tt>get/set</tt> and
     <tt>appendToStatusArea</tt> methods).  This interface is to be named
     based on the name of the dialog (i.e. the name of the project being
     compiled) as follows: project_name + "FieldEdit".  For example, if the
     project is called "StudentRec", the generated interface should be called
     <tt>StudentRecFieldEdit</tt>.
<p>
</p></li><li> NOTE: It should be assumed that the user-provided <tt>ActionListener</tt>
     provides a constructor which takes a reference to the interface
     defined above as its single argument.  This allows the user-defined
     <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes to be written under the assumption that
     it can access the public get/set and appendToStatusArea methods provided
     by the dialog class, without needing to type cast.
</li></ul>

<br>
<h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>
<p>
First, you should ensure that any deficiencies in your first assignment are
corrected - without the first assignment working to at least some degree, it
will be impossible to complete this assignment.  A working copy of assignment
1 will <u><b>not</b></u> be provided for you to work from, and the use of
another person's assignment 1 will be treated as academic misconduct.
</p><p>
You will construct the GUI in Java using the <tt>javax.swing</tt> package,
which for the purpose of compilation will make use of the Java Native Interface
(JNI) to leverage the ParameterManager library, implemented in C, that you
wrote for for assignment 1 to set up and perform the necessary parsing and
output out of the appropriate Java program.  Control passes from the Java that
implements your interface to functions you implemented in the ParamterManager
to do the first-stage parse of the relevant <tt>.config</tt> file; once this
is done the Java layer should create and configure the second parameter
manager in the same way to extract the specific values on the second-stage
pass of the file.  Based on the values you parse from the file, the Java GUI
will write out the Java code that implements the dialog described to an
appropriately organized directory and set of files (as specified above).
</p><p>
Note that you will ultimately need to build the C code into a shared library
(shared object file if you prefer), rather than a static one as was the case
in A1.  The process for doing this is straightforward and will be reviewed
in class/seminar.  The name of the shared library produced for the purpose of
supporting JNI integration should be <tt>libJNIpm.so</tt>.
</p><p>
You should take care to handle the interaction between the Java GUI and the
C library appropriately so that errors generated by the C code are formatted
and output appropriately in the error window should there be problems during
the compilation process.  That is to say that although errors are primarily
detected in the C library, it is the Java GUI's responsibility to format and
output these messages in the appropriate manner.
</p><p>
The integrated development environment Java application that you develop should
be called <tt><b>Dialogc</b></tt> (i.e. the main routine is in a class called
<tt>Dialogc</tt>, which appears in a file called <tt>Dialogc.java</tt>).  You
are free to organize your build hierarchy and file organization as you see fit
otherwise.
</p><p>
We will test your program with our own test files.  If our programs
fail to compile or run because your compiler does not correctly follow the
specification, you will receive 0 (zero) marks!

<br><br><br>

</p><h3>Makefile</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for generating a Makefile to compile your code.  Typing
"<tt>make</tt>" or "<tt>make Dialogc</tt>" should result in the
compilation of all required components with the result being the ability to
invoke the Java GUI from the command line and your application executing
correctly (note: this makefile must correctly compile both the C library and
the Java code that implements the GUI).  You should ensure that all required
dependencies are specified correctly.
<br><br>

</p><hr>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
<li> Source code:
     <ul>
	 <li>Source code for the <b>Dialogc</b> compiler (C code: the parameter
         manager library; Java code: the IDE/compiler implementation), and
         any other source files necessary for compilation).</li>
     <li>a <tt>Makefile</tt> must be provided that compiles (properly)
         everything required for the assignment when <tt>make all</tt> is
         executed</li>
    <li><b>NOTE</b>: The required <tt>README</tt> file containing instructions
        and notes for the marker is to be integrated into your GUI in the Help
        menu (see above).  See

          use of this repository over time.</li>
     <li> Doing all development first and then importing it all to your
          repository purely for submission defeats the purpose of using
