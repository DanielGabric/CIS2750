<br><br>

Key Concepts: <i>SQL; database integration; scripting</i>.
</center>

<br><br>

<p>
We now consider the final components of our dialog compiler system in which
(1) the dialog applications emitted by the compiler have built-in support
for data management via a postgres database, and (2) the code base and
installation process for the system are properly organized, streamlined and 
automated.  The general idea is that these dialog-based applications now
possess built-in functionality for interacting with a database, and thus are
suitable for use as (admittedly crude) data management systems (managing
customer records, student data, inventory, etc.).  Consider an organization
with a vast array of dynamic information storage needs, and for which there
is an ongoing requirement that new and modified front-ends be available to
access this information for a wide range of users.  To this end, you have
developed a dialog compiler which allows for the specification and production
of simple "database-lite" front ends that are easily configured and extended.
</p><p>
In this assignment, you will build on your assignment 3 implementation to
complete the system by integrating database access support into the Java code
output by your compiler.  You will also develop a script-based installer with
which system setup can be configured and automated.
</p><p>
Read the following sections carefully to ensure that you know what is to be
done and what is to be handed in. There are many details that must be handled
correctly for you to receive full marks on this assignment; you should pay
attention to these details.   Your makefile must correctly produce the program
required, and each function, type and program file must be correctly named and
must behave in the appropriate way. If the details aren't addressed
successfully you will lose marks.  Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#style">coding style guidelines</a> to provide
direction regarding the format of the code you write.  You are expected to
work independently on this assignment (please see notes on
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/outline.html#cheating">academic misconduct in computing</a>
for clarification if necessary).

<center><h3>Dialog Compiler (release version with database integration)</h3></center>

<p>
Add support for database integration to the Java dialogs output by your
compiler.  This is to be accomplished through the provision of four (4)
pre-defined <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes as part of any compiled dialog
(that is to say, these <tt>ActionListener</tt>s are provided by your system,
and not implemented separately by the user).  Your <tt>ActionListener</tt>
classes will make use of the <i>Java database connectivity</i> (<b>JDBC</b>)
API to connect to a postgres database that is provided for your use.  It is
implicit that each compiled dialog interacts with a table unique to that
application (i.e. there may be many tables in your database, each associated
with a different dialog).  note that due to the nature of this implementation
the set-up of the database will be handled in an asynchronous manner---all
relevant <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes will take steps to ensure the
appropriate table is present in the database, creating it as necessary if
this is the first access by the dialog.
<br><br>

</p><h4>Dialog == Table</h4>
<p>
There is a one-to-one mapping between a given dialog application, and a
table in the database in which records corresponding to the fields of the
dialog can be stored.  We must use a primary key field for these tables,
however since we can assume nothing about what kinds of dialogs will be
generated, we will impose a new field on the dialog which will appear <u>in
addition to</u> those declared in the input file(s).  This field will always
be called <i><b>ID</b></i>, be of type <tt>integer</tt>, appear first in the
dialog display, and corresponds to an <tt>auto_increment</tt> field in the
database (so IDs will automatically be assigned to records as they are added).
</p><p>
By way of example, the video_way_customer_records example from a3 would result
in a dialog with an ID field above the <tt>membernumber</tt> that already
appears in that example, given the same input file (the generation of the ID
field is automatic)
<br><br>


</p><h4>ADD, DELETE, QUERY, UPDATE are <u>reserved</u> names for buttons</h4>
<p>
To this point the user had complete control over the names of buttons and the
<tt>ActionListener</tt> objects attached to them.  This is no longer the case.
The exact names (case-sensitive) <tt>ADD</tt>, <tt>DELETE</tt>, <tt>QUERY</tt>
and <tt>UPDATE</tt> should now correspond explicitly to the four pre-defined
<tt>ActionListener</tt> classes described below---it is up to you if you will
allow the user to specify custom buttons with the same names where the case
varies.  The user need not provide an <tt>ActionListener</tt> name for these
pre-defined buttons.  The ones described below are automatically attached
when one of these reserved buttons is declared.

</p><h4>Database <tt>ActionListener</tt> Classes</h4>
<p>
The reserved (pre-defined) buttons described above correspond to the following
<tt>ActionListener</tt> classes you are to implement and provide as part of
the compiled dialog.  Note: you are free to generate these classes dynamically
if you wish, and you should only be providing those classes that are necessary
given the specific input (i.e. if there is no delete button, you shouldn't be
provisioning the corresponding <tt>ActionListener</tt> class for that dialog).
</p><p>
The required behaviour of these <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes with respect
to the contents of the dialog fields is described below.  Note that in each
case you are provided with a set of criteria---it is the task of the
<tt>ActionListener</tt> to ensure these criteria are met; this includes
creating the full table for the specific dialog if there is not one already
in the DB.
</p><dl>
<dt> <u>ADD</u>: <i>add a record to the database</i></dt>
     <dd> DB table for this dialog must exist (it should be created if it
	 is not already present in the DB); all fields must contain valid
	 data, except the ID field which must be empty; any errors with this
	 operation should be reported to the status area in a meaningful way; if
	 the operation succeeds, a message in the status area should indicate
	 this, and the ID field should now contain the ID value assigned by the
	 DB.</dd>
<p>
</p><dt> <u>DELETE</u>: <i>delete all records which meet the input criteria</i></dt>
     <dd> DB table for this dialog must exist (it should be created if it
     is not already present in the DB); all records that have values in all
     corresponding to the contents of the non-empty input fields in
     the dialog application (note that not all fields are required to have
     a value---if you enter only the ID value, only one record will be
     deleted; however, if you enter values for multiple non-primary key
     fields it is possible to delete many records at once); all non-empty
     fields must contain valid values; <u>all</u> delete operations should
     pop up a window displaying a summary of the records that will be
     deleted and request confirmation before proceeding; any errors with
     this operation should be reported to the status area in a meaningful
     way; correct operation should report the number of entries deleted
     from the DB.</dd>
<p>
</p><dt> <u>UPDATE</u>: <i>update fields in the database record with the
                       specified primary key (ID)</i></dt>
     <dd> DB table for this dialog must exist (it should be created if it is
     not already present in the DB); only non-empty fields should be updated;
     it is an error to attempt an update on a non-existent primary key, or
     with illegal values in input fields; any errors with this operation
     should be reported to the status area in a meaningful way; correct
     operation should also be reported to the status area, and the newly
     updated record loaded into the fields of the dialog.</dd>
<p>
</p><dt> <u>QUERY</u>: <i>display all records that meet the input criteria</i></dt>
     <dd> the database should be queried for all records which match the
     non-empty text entry fields, and the resulting records formatted sensibly
     and displayed in the status area; if the ID field has a value (implying
     there is at most one result) this operation should also populate all
     dialog fields with the full contents of the record---any other values
     currently in fields should be overwritten; any errors with this operation
     should be reported to the status area in a meaningful way.
</dd></dl>

NOTE 1: All database interaction is to occur in these <tt>ActionListener</tt>
classes; you should not be modifying the Java being output to implement the
dialog to support this (the only edit to the output of existing code is
the automatic inclusion of the ID field---all DB-handling details are to
be addressed in your <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes.
<p>
NOTE 2: The database connection information is provided during the installation
of your software (see below); you should be incorporating this information
automatically to support the functionality of your <tt>ActionListener</tt>
classes (e.g. proving a local config file, inserting the relevant information
into the generated classes dynamically, assuming you are generating them at
compile time, etc.).

<br><br>
</p><hr>

<center><h3>Installation Script</h3></center>
<p>
You are to provide a self-extracting script (bash or python) to perform the
installation and setup of your system.  We should not have to understand any
aspect of the installation or compilation of your system aside from the
interaction with the script described here.  Installation will be performed as
follows:
</p><p>
Your self-contained, self-extracting install script (which is the only
component of submission) should be called <tt>install_dialogc.sh</tt> or
<tt>install_dialogc.py</tt>, depending if you use bash or python respectively.
This script will be run at the command-line and should perform the following:

</p><ol>
<li> Display whatever start-up title you wish
</li><li> Inform the user how you intend to install the system (e.g. if you are
     going to unpack the source code in a subdirectory of the current one and
     perform the build there, etc.), and obtain confirmation that the script
     can proceed
</li><li> Extract the build from the script, unpack it and compile the system
     reporting errors to the user as necessary
</li><li> Assuming the build was successful, prompt for a directory in which
     to install the system
</li><li> If the directory already exists: ensure that i have write permission on
     it, otherwise inform the user that the directory does not exist and
     prompt for it's creation.  If the user answers no, installation should
     stop, otherwise you should attempt to create whatever directories are
     necessary to create the full path specified by the user (again, reporting
     failure and aborting if these directories cannot be created for reasons
     of permissions, etc).
</li><li> This directory is considered the "base" directory for the installation of
     your system.  Inside this directory should be the following:
     <ul>
     <li> <tt>bin</tt> directory in which the "executables" reside (i.e. the
          dialogc IDE and command-line compiler)
     </li><li> <tt>lib</tt> directory in which the parameter manager-related
          libraries reside; this includes <tt>libjnipm.so</tt>, and should
          also include <tt>libpm.a</tt> if you rely on having both libraries
          present for whatever reason.
     </li><li> no files related to the build should be present in the installation
          directories (source code, object files, etc.)
     </li></ul>
</li><li> The installer needs to modify the user's <tt>.bashrc</tt> file so
     that an appropriate <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> value is set automatically
     when the user logs in (i.e. the user should not be required to set this
     themselves); the script should inform the user that it is doing this
     and confirm the change.
</li><li> The installer will also need to set up appropriate defaults for the
     Java compiler, compiler arguments, jre and jre arguments; we will leave
     this as a design issue however suggestions include: generating a
     "definitions" class as part of the build prior to compilation to set
     these values, placing a <tt>.dialogc</tt> file in the user's home
     directory that contains these values to be read by the compiler when it
     is invoked, etc.  Note that you cannot assume that you know the username
     prior to installation (hint: there is a <tt>HOME</tt> environment variable
     available that can be used when the script runs)---don't be silly and
     start hard-coding paths to your own home directory during development as
     that isn't going to work when we try to run it.  How you obtain values
     for these defaults is also left as an exercise (prompt for it, look for
     the executable on the local disk, etc.).
</li><li> Copy all relevant files into the <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directories
     specified above (at this point, assuming the user logs out and back in,
     or sources their <tt>.bashrc</tt> file, it should be possible to execute
     the IDE and begin using it).
</li><li> Clean up the remains of the compile so that anything that was purely part
     of the build process is removed from the system cleanly; only the
     installed system remains.
</li><li> <b>Note: your script must support the following command-line flags:</b>
     <ul>
     <li> <tt>--build</tt>: the script should only perform actions up
          to the building of the code and then stop, leaving the build
          directory in place ready for a subsequent installation
     </li><li> <tt>--install</tt>: the script should only perform actions after
          the building of the code, and assumes the build was already
          performed; if there is no build present an appropriate error should
          be displayed to the user and the script should exit
     </li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
Your install script should provide meaningful feedback to the user as the
installation progresses, and should strive to hide the output from programs
being run within the script (e.g. "compiling system" output as the system is
being made, with no output from the compilation process itself - hint: you can
always redirect output to <tt>/dev/null</tt>).
<br><br>

</p><hr>

<h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>
<p>
You must base the implementation of this assignment on the version of the
system you developed for assignment 3.  It is expected at this point that
the entire product from the sequence of the assignments in this course
works in its entirety (specifically: you could make use of the
<tt>parametermanager</tt> library directly in other code, write and compile
DB-enabled dialogs from within the IDE and using the external command-line
compiler invoked either from within the IDE or on the command-line directly).
You can expect penalties to be applied for absent functionality that was
required on the assignments leading up to this one.  <i>Given the limited
time available prior to the final exam, you should be taking extra care in
testing your submission to ensure correctness; there will be little time
or patience for non-functional submissions</i>.
</p><p>
You are required to implement the database integration with the JDBC API,
making use of the postgres database provided for your use (details regarding
the database server will be provided in class).
</p><p>
Wherever possible, the <tt>ActionListener</tt> classes you implement and
provide as part of the system should be responsible for error checking
(determining if all required fields are non-empty, validating types, etc.).
Note that most of this is already incorporated into the system you have
implemented previously, however it is the <tt>ActionListener</tt>'s job to
perform their function properly and make use of the hooks you have provided
for this purpose.
</p><p>
The Java IDE should still be called <b>Dialogc</b>, and the command-line
compiler generated by lex and yacc should be compiled into an executable
<b>yadc</b>.
</p><p>
The installation script is to be entirely self-contained; the only thing
in your repository when you submit should be this script.  The tarball
containing the source code for building the system must be part of the
script.  This implies that the script must be able to apply some process
to itself in order to extract the tarball --- have a look at <tt>uuencode</tt>
or <tt>mime</tt>-related tools for this purpose (this will be covered in lab
as well for reference).
</p><p>
We will test your program with our own test files.  If our programs
fail to compile or run because your compiler does not correctly follow the
specification, you will receive 0 (zero) marks!
<br><br><br>


</p><h3>Makefile</h3>
<p>
The compilation process, while automated by your script, is still required
to be managed through a Makefile.  You are responsible for providing the
makefile to compile your code.  Assuming the build directory is present (i.e.
extracted from the install script), typing "<tt>make</tt>" or
"<tt>make dialogc</tt>" should result in the production and compilation of all
required components with the result being the ability to invoke the Java IDE
from the command line and your application executing correctly (note: this
makefile must correctly compile the C library, the Java code that implements
the gui and the lex/yacc that implements the command-line compiler).  You
should ensure that all required dependencies are specified correctly.
<br><br><br>

</p><hr>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
Note: as stated above, the exact organization of the source code component of
your submission is largely up to you.  we expect to be able to run the install
script and have the system installed as described.
<ul>
<li> Installer:
     <ul>
     <li>A self-contained, self-extracting installer script is the only
         thing submitted for this assignment (<tt>install_dialogc.sh</tt> or
         <tt>install_dialogc.py</tt> depending if you implemented the script
         using bash or python.
     </li><li>Note that the installer implicitly includes the source code/build
         materials.
    </li></ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Use of repository:
     <ul>
     <li> Students are <u>required</u> to use the course-provided git
          repository for revision control management during development.  there
          will be mark deductions for failure to make use of this repository
          over time.</li>
     <li> Doing all development first and then importing it all to your
          repository purely for submission defeats the purpose of using
          revision control and is unacceptable.  You must be making use of
          your repository during development.</li>
     </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Apply release tag for submission:
     <ul>
     <li> The source code and documentation making up your submission should be
          tagged appropriately in your git repository prior to the due
          time, as described in the
          <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#submissions">submission guidelines</a>
          for the course.</li>
	 <p>
     </p><li> <div class="attention">
              <font size="+2">The tag to be used for this assignment
              submission is: <b><tt>2750W15_A4</tt></b></font>
          </div>
          <p>
          <b><i>Be absolutely certain that your repository is tagged correctly
          as this is the exact (and only) tag we will pull from your repository
          for grading purposes.</i></b></p></li>
     </ul></li>
