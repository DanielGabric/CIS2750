<b>Due:</b> January 18, 2015 at midnight
<br><br>

Key concepts: <i>Library implementation in C; coding to a specification;
              file handling; parsing</i>.
</center>

<br><br>

A common requirement of an application is the ability to read a set of
parameters from an external source (a file for example).  This is often used
to maintain configuration information between executions of the application.
An example of this is the <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/A1/pinerc">.pinerc</a> file for the pine
mailer.  It is somewhat wasteful to write application-specific code to
perform this function for every applications that uses it.  Your task will
be to implement a library of routines that can be sufficiently configured
to perform this task for a wide variety of applications.
<p>
What follows is a detailed specification of the abstract data types and
related functionality that is required of your library.  It is critical
that you fully understand what you are required to produce---if you find
any aspect of this specification unclear, it is your responsibility to have
it clarified.  This is important in order to satisfy 2 objectives of this
assignment: 1) giving you experience implementing a specification and 2) since
this library will serve as the basis for future assignment(s), it is in your
best interest to ensure it is implemented correctly now.
</p><p>
Read the following sections carefully to ensure that you know what is to be
done and what is to be handed in. There are many details that must be handled
correctly for you to receive full marks on this assignment; you should pay
attention to these details.   Your Makefile must correctly produce the library
required, and each function, type and program file must be correctly named and
must behave in the appropriate way. If the details aren't addressed
successfully you will lose marks.  Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#style">coding style guidelines</a> to provide
direction regarding the format of the code you write.  You are expected to
work independently on this assignment (please see notes on
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/outline.html#cheating">academic misconduct in computing</a> for
clarification if necessary).

<center><h3>Parameter Management Library</h3></center>

The library you are to write will provide a type (<tt>ParameterManager</tt>)
and a set of operations defined on this type.  These operations will support:
declaration, construction and destruction of objects of this type;
registration of parameters with such an object to later be parsed from an
external source; and obtaining the values assigned to parameters during
parsing.  The parameter manager will support the typing of parameters
(validated during parsing), and supports "optional" parameters that need
not appear in the input stream.  <u>This library is to be written in C</u>.
<i>Please note that it is a requirement of all assignments that you utilize the
course-provided git repository for revision management and submission.
See deliverables section below for additional detail.</i>
<p>
It is your responsibility to design and code appropriate data structures
to implement this specification.  Spend some time thinking about what
information your data structure will need to track and design an appropriate
structure <b>before</b> you commit to something inadequate by writing a lot
of code.  Remember that your library is being used by an application, and all
that application wants to know about your library is that by including the
necessary header file, it can declare variables of a given type, and pass
them to function you provide to carry out specific tasks.  The application
should not be concerned with your particular implementation details (which is
in-keeping with the notion of an abstract data type).

</p><h3>ADT specifications:</h3>
In the ADT specifications that follow, there is always the implicit
precondition that any provided ADT object is valid.

<p>
</p><div class="announce">
<center><u>ParameterManager ADT</u></center>
<p>
<b>Definition</b>:<br>
A ParameterManager is a facility for the tracking, parsing and retrieval of
parameters from an input stream.  Parameters are supported in one of the
following formats:
</p><pre>name = value;
name = { [value1 [, value2, ...]] };
</pre>

<p>
<b>Operations</b> (as C function prototypes):<br>
</p><dl>
<dt>
     <code>ParameterManager * PM_create(int size);</code>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Creates a new parameter manager object</u><br>
     PRE: size is a positive integer (see note 1 below)<br>
     POST: Returns a new parameter manager object initialized to be empty
           (i.e. managing no parameters) on success, NULL otherwise (memory
           allocation failure)
</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
     <code>int PM_destroy(ParameterManager *p);</code>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Destroys a parameter manager object</u><br>
     PRE: n/a<br>
     POST: all memory associated with parameter manager <code>p</code> is
           freed; returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
     <code>int PM_parseFrom(ParameterManager *p, FILE *fp, char comment);</code>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Extract values for parameters from an input stream</u> (see note 2
         below)<br>
     PRE: <code>fp</code> is a valid input stream ready for reading that
          contains the desired parameters<br>
     POST: All required parameters, and those optional parameters present, are
           assigned values that are consumed from <code>fp</code>, respecting
           <code>comment</code> as a "start of comment to end of line"
           character if not nul ('\0'); returns non-zero on success, 0
           otherwise (parse error,memory allocation failure)</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
     <code>int PM_manage(ParameterManager *p, char *pname, param_t ptype,
                         int required);</code>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Register parameter for management</u><br>
     PRE: <code>pname</code> does not duplicate the name of a parameter already
          managed<br>
     POST: Parameter named <code>pname</code> of type <code>ptype</code> (see
           note 3 below) is registered with <code>p</code> as a parameter;  if
           <code>required</code> is zero the parameter will be considered
           optional, otherwise it will be considered required; returns 1 on
           success, 0 otherwise (duplicate name, memory allocation failure)<br>
</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
     <code>int PM_hasValue(ParameterManager *p, char *pname);</code>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Test if a parameter has been assigned a value</u><br>
     PRE: <code>pname</code> is currently managed by <code>p</code><br>
     POST: Returns 1 if <code>pname</code> has been assigned a value, 0
           otherwise (no value, unknown parameter)<br>
</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
     <code>union param_value PM_getValue(ParameterManager *p,
                                         char *pname);</code><br>
</dt>
<dd>
     <u>Obtain the value assigned to <code>pname</code></u><br>
     PRE: <code>pname</code> is currently managed by <code>p</code> and has
           been assigned a value<br>
     POST: Returns the value (see note 4 below) assigned to <code>pname</code>;
           result is undefined if <code>pname</code> has not been assigned
           a value or is unknown<br>
</dd>
<br>
<hr>
<hr>
<br>
<b>Implementation Issues</b>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> The <code>size</code> argument can be, but is not required to be, the
     number of parameters to be managed by the new object; it can however be
     used for any other suitable purpose (e.g. the size of a hash table used
     to store the parameters).</li>
<p>
</p><li> Note the following when parsing parameters from the input stream:
     <ul>
     <li> parameter names are case-sensitive (i.e. Name != name)</li>
     <li> parameters can occur in any order</li>
     <li> required parameters must be present, however optional ones may or
          may not be present - neither of which is an error</li>
     <li> <tt>LIST_TYPE</tt> values can be an empty list (e.g.
          <code>name = {};</code>)</li>
     <li> any violation of the expected format is a parse error</li>
     <li> the type of a parameter must be enforced - an incorrectly typed
          value for a parameter is a parse error</li>
     <li> parameters are terminated by semi-colons (not end-of-line) so can
          span multiple lines, have comments in the middle of them, etc.</li>
     </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> You must provide symbolic constants (e.g. as an enumeration) in the
     header file for your library to represent the supported parameter types,
     which are:
     <ul>
     <li> INT_TYPE - integer values (positive and negative) </li>
     <li> REAL_TYPE - floating point values </li>
     <li> BOOLEAN_TYPE - boolean values ("true" and "false") </li>
     <li> STRING_TYPE - character strings <font color="red">(note: strings are
          delimitted by double quotes e.g. "First Name")</font></li>
     <li> LIST_TYPE - sequence of comma-separated strings
          <font color="red">(note: these strings are also delimitted by
          double quotes e.g. "list val 1")</font></li>

     </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Values assigned to parameters should be stored and returned in the
     following union data type (which should appear in your header file to
     make it available outside your library):
<pre>union param_value
{
    int           int_val;
    float         real_val;
    Boolean       bool_val;   /* see additional types section below */
    char          *str_val;
    ParameterList *list_val;  /* see additional types section below */
};
</pre>
     This allows the value of a parameter to be stored in the same field
     regardless of type, and places the responsibility for interpreting the
     type correctly on the calling module.
</li></ol>
</dl></div>

<u> Your library should provide 2 additional types for utility and
    completeness </u>

</p><ol>
<li> You should provide a type definition to allow the application to declare
     variables of type <code>Boolean</code> and symbolic constants to allow the
     use of literals <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> for assignment,
     conditionals, etc.</li>

<b>Implementation Issues</b>
<p>
This type is provided to hold the sequence of values that make up the
value of a <tt>LIST_TYPE</tt> parameter, all of which are considered to
be strings.  The only operation required of the application is one to
iteratively return the items on the list.  You are not required to provide
any means of traversing the list more than once.

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
There are many accepted styles for implementing ADTs.  The one that will be
adopted here has the ADT defined to be whatever data type (atomic or
structured) that is appropriate; however, the expectation is that variables of
this type will always be declared as pointers to the type.  This implies that
<code>PM_create()</code> returns a pointer to the
ParameterManager type, which will be assigned to an appropriate variable on
return.  Further, as is the case in the functions specified above, the subject
of an ADT operation is always passed as a pointer.  This serves to make
the declaration, creation, use and destruction of ADTs consistent in all
situations.  These concepts are illustrated in the example to follow.
</p><p>
The following is an example of an application using the library specified in
this assignment (<i><b>this is simply a usage example---you should not be using
this as your only test case; it doesn't end well</b></i>).
</p><p>
Example application: <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/A1/a1example.c">a1example.c</a> which might be used
to extract parameters from a file such as
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/A1/a1config.txt">a1config.txt</a>.
<br><br><br>

</p><h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>
<p>
The implementation of the <b>ParameterManager</b> library is to be realized
with at least two files: <tt>ParameterManager.h</tt> which is to contain
all function prototypes and data declarations (types, constants, etc.)
required to use your library, and <tt>ParameterManager.c</tt> which
will contain the implementation of the functions and any supporting code for
the various data types contained in this specification.
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10">
<tbody><tr><td>
<b>Please note</b>: the types in question <u>must</u> be called
<tt>ParameterManager</tt>, <tt>Boolean</tt> and <tt>ParameterList</tt>.
Similarly, functions must have the same names and parameter declarations
that are provided in the specification.  The compiled library is to be called
<tt>libpm.a</tt>.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
You are free to use additional source and/or header files as you see fit, and
may implement additional functions and types to facilitate your implementation,
however these should be considered internal to you library.  In any case, it
will be assumed that the only header file required to make use of your library
is <tt>ParameterManager.h</tt>.
</p><p>
Your library will be tested with our own test programs. If our programs
fail to compile or run because your module does not correctly follow the
specification, you will receive 0 (zero) marks!

<br><br><br>

</p><h3>Makefile</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for generating a Makefile to compile your code.  Typing
"<tt>make</tt>" or "<tt>make ParameterManager</tt>" should result in the
compilation of all required components with the result being your library
(<tt>libpm.a</tt>).  You should ensure that all required dependencies are
specified correctly.

    <li> implementation of your <b>ParameterManager</b> library
        (<tt>ParameterManager.c, ParameterManager.h</tt> and any other
        source files necessary for compilation).</li>
    <li> a <tt>Makefile</tt> must be provided that compiles (properly)
         everything required for the assignment when <tt>make all</tt> is
         executed.</li>
    <li>The required <tt>README</tt> file containing instructions and notes for

	<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#submissions">assignment
        guidelines</a> for details regarding these files.</li>
    <li>Any additional files required by the above</li>
    </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Use of Repository:
    <ul>
    <li> Students are <u>required</u> to use the course-provided gid
         repository for revision control management during development.  Grade
	 pentalties will apply if you do not make use of this repository over

    <li> Doing all development first and then importing it all to your
         repository purely for submission defeats the purpose of using
