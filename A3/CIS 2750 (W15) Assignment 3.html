<br><br>

Key concepts: <i>lex and yacc; System integration</i>.
</center>

<br><br>

In the first assignment, you built a general purpose library that could be
configured at run-time to provide parsing services for reading "parameters"
from an input stream.  In the second assignment we considered a particular
application - a simple compiler that output Java programs that implement a
text-entry dialog with buttons.
<p>
One approach to constructing such a system is to make use of software
components we already have.  In the case of assignment 2, we did exactly this
by using the parameter manager to perform parsing for us in the construction
of the compiler.  Assuming we did not have suitable software components for
re-use, we would have to consider what software tools are available to us
with which to implement it from the ground up.  In the case of compilers, and
parsers in general, this is a chore typically assigned to lex and yacc.  Your
task in this assignment is to re-implement the compiler as specified in
assignment 2, using lex and yacc.
</p><p>
Read the following sections carefully to ensure that you know what is to be
done and what is to be handed in. There are many details that must be handled
correctly for you to receive full marks on this assignment; you should pay
attention to these details.   Your Makefile must correctly produce the program
required, and each function, type and program file must be correctly named and
must behave in the appropriate way. If the details aren't addressed
successfully you will lose marks.  Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#style">coding style guidelines</a> to provide
direction regarding the format of the code you write.  You are expected to
work independently on this assignment (please see notes on 
<a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/outline.html#cheating">academic misconduct in computing</a>
for clarification if necessary).

<center><h3>Dialog Compiler (lex/yacc version)</h3></center>

<p>
Re-implement the compiler portion of assignment 2 using lex and
yacc.  Note that the output of lex and yacc is C code which implements
the parser you described in the lex and yacc configuration files, which
then must be compiled to produce an executable.  This command-line compiler
should be called <tt>yadc</tt>.
</p><p>
Since it is an executable, you should be able to invoke this compiler directly
from the command-line if desired (subject to the constraints on the input
file, noted below), however we will integrate it into our IDE as a second
option for performing compilation of Java dialogs.
</p><p>
<b>Note: you are not to remove the existing functionality of your
IDE compiler; the lex/yacc-based compiler will be incorporated to provide a
second option for performing the same task</b>.
<br><br><br>

</p><p>
</p><h3>Additional Requirements</h3>
<p>
<u><i>The <b>Config</b> menu in your IDE is now required to have an additional
option to select the compilation mode:</i></u>
</p><p>
</p><h4><u>Config:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li> ... </li>
<li> <b>Compile Mode</b> - specify use of the IDE or the external
     lex/yacc-based compiler
     <ul>
     <li> this option should be implemented as a pair of clearly labelled
          radio buttons only one of which can be selected (the default
          should be the external lex/yacc compiler for the purpose of this
          assignment).
     </li><li> the selection here dictates how the compilation of input file(s)
          to Java should be accomplished, regardless of how the compile
          is triggered (i.e. menu option, toolbar button, etc.)
     </li><li> note that all other behaviour of the application should remain
          as specified in A2, only the process of compilation to Java
          changes (done by the IDE using JNI and the ParameterManager library
          as in A2, or by invoking the external lex/yacc compiler)
     </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br>

<p>
<u><i> The Java code output by your compiler is now required to have additional
functionality:</i></u>
</p><ol>
<li> Note that the automatically generated <tt>getDCFieldName</tt> methods 
     invoked (by the <tt>ActionListener</tt> attached to the button for
     example) should be validing the contents of the text entry areas (fields)
     to ensure that the value contained in that field is the correct type as
     declared in the input files.  We'll formalize this behaviour by stating
     that if the type of the entry is not correct, the method should throw
     a <tt>IllegalFieldValueException</tt> that you will need to
     generate---the user-provided <tt>ActionListener</tt> will assume it
     exists and can be used.  The String message associated
     with the exception should be the actual contents of the text entry field.
     (This exception can be caught in the <tt>ActionListener</tt> and
     appropriate action taken --- this is not your concern beyond making sure
     the correct exception is thrown).  Assuming the contents of the field
     are appropriate, the contents of that field should be returned as a
     <tt>String</tt>.
     <p>
     As part of your testing, you may find it helpful to define an
     <tt>ActionListener</tt> that queries the contents of all the fields and
     outputs their value (or an error message) to the status area.  This
     will help ensure you are implementing all the various requirements
     related to supporting the externally defined <tt>ActionListener</tt>
     appropriately.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> The input file used by the lex/yacc compiler can be treated in a more
     restricted fashion (i.e. the external compiler may give parse errors on
     something the IDE could handle without issue).  For the purpose of the
     external compiler only, you can assume  that the "title", "fields" and
     "buttons" parameters appear first (think of them like a variable
     declaration in C).  If you encounter anything other than these 3 fields
     first, you may consider it a parse error.  Similarly, it is a parser
     error if you encounter subsequent input that contain field or button
     names that you do not recognize.</li>
<p>	 
</p><li> You can assume the following additional restrictions on the input for
     the new lex/yacc compiler only if you wish:
     <ul>
     <li> input will be in order: title, fields and buttons, followed by
          field types, followed by button functions.</li>
     <li> field and button names must be unique (that is to say, you cannot
          simultaneously have a field and button named "example").</li>
     </ul>
     You cannot assume that all input will conform to these assumptions, but
     if you wish to consider them as parse errors, that is permitted.</li>
<p>
</p><li> Please note that the assumptions related to the format of the input file,
     noted in points 2 and 3 above, are only applicable when the
     lex/yacc compiler is being used.  Your IDE-based compiler should still
     work as originally specified (note that the <tt>#!#</tt> section delimiter
     will just be ignored by the lex/yacc compiler as a comment).</li>
</ol>
NOTE: you may need to output additional code to the compiled Java application
to support this behaviour (i.e. methods to implement some operations, data
structures that may be necessary to track information, etc.).
<br><br><br>

<h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>
<p>
What you write for this assignment is providing an <u>alternate</u> means
of performing the compilation from input file(s) to Java code that implements
the specified dialog.  The Java IDE compiler from the previous assignment
should remain intact, the only difference is that it is now possible to specify
whether to use the compiler built into the IDE with JNI, or the external
executable compiler that you implement using lex and yacc.
</p><p>
You will write the new compiler entirely in lex and yacc; however, you are
free to implement any additional functionality you find necessary to support
the activities of lex and yacc (a symbol table for example to keep track of the
values assigned to strings you read in).
</p><p>
Note that you must still manage the interface between the IDE editor and the
new external compiler (i.e. when the IDE invokes the external compiler, it
should pass whatever arguments are necessary, and capture the output from the
program to report error messages to the user).  If it is necessary to run
the compiled dialog, it will still have to be handled by the IDE --- the
command-line compiler's only job is to read the input file and generate the
Java code that implements the dialog.
</p><p>
The Java IDE should still be called <b>Dialogc</b>, subject to all previously
provided specifications along with any fixes or modifications required by
this assignment, and the compiler generated by lex and yacc should be compiled
into an executable called <tt><b>yadc</b></tt>.
</p><p>
We will test your program with our own test files.  If our programs
fail to compile or run because your compiler does not correctly follow the
specification, you will receive 0 (zero) marks!
<br><br><br>

</p><h3>Example</h3>
<p>
This is an example of an input file that would be suitable for the command-line
compiler along with a screenshot of what the resulting compiled dialog would
look like (in this case, running under a NeXT-themed GUI---the window dressing
is irrelevant).  While you may have restrictions on the format of
the input (as noted above) for the purpose of the lex/yacc-based compiler,
your IDE should <u>not</u> suffer from the same problem---thus it is possible
to have input file(s) that can be compiled using the IDE compiler, but
generate parse errors from the external compiler due to additional assumptions
regarding the input.  This is expected.  The behaviour of the compiled dialog
should be identical regardless of whether it was compiled using the IDE or
external compiler.
</p><p>
In this example, an <tt>ActionListener</tt> class has been attached to the
buttons that get and print the values of the dialog fields to the status
area (note that you can infer that it is validating the contents of the
fields; the <tt>ActionListener</tt> outputs a different message when it
catches the <tt>IllegalFieldValueException</tt>).
</p><p>
contents of: <tt>video.config</tt>:
<br><br><br>
</p><pre>title = "Video Way Customer Records";    # Video Way db application

fields = { "MemberNumber",
           "LastName",
           "FirstName",
           "Address",
           "TotalRentals",
           "Account_balance"};

# Here are some database-looking buttons (wonder where this is going...)
buttons = { "Add", "Update", "Delete", "Query", "Print" };

#!#

#
# Field type declarations
#
MemberNumber = "integer";
LastName = "string";
FirstName = "string";
Address = "string";
TotalRentals = "integer";
Account_balance = "float";

#
# Button function declaration
#
Add = "QueryListener";
Update = "QueryListener";
Delete = "QueryListener";
Query = "QueryListener";
Print = "QueryListener";
</pre>

</p><h3>NOTE THE FOLLOWING</h3>

This is only an <u>example</u> of an input file and the resulting application.
It does not embody all the possible legal variations of an input file---do
not use this example as the sole test case guiding your implementation.
<p>
There are a number of flexible issues in the design of your yacc grammar;
consider the following:
</p><ul>
<li> What will you do with this: <tt>fields = { };</tt>
</li><li> What will you do with this: <tt>buttons = { };</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>
These are simply some examples of things worth thinking about as you design
your grammar (and thus define what your command-line compiler accepts as
input).  Try to understand the issues, and make reasonable decisions.
<br><br><br>

</p><h3>Makefile</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for generating a Makefile to compile your code.  Typing
"<tt>make</tt>" or "<tt>make Dialogc</tt>" should result in the
production and compilation of all required components with the result being
the ability to invoke the Java IDE from the command line and your application
executing correctly (note: this makefile must correctly compile the C library,
the Java code that implements the GUI and the lex/yacc that implements the
command-line compiler).  You should ensure that all required dependencies are
specified correctly.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
<li> Source code:
     <ul>
     <li>Source code for the dual-implementation <b>Dialogc</b> compiler
         (C code: the parameter manager library; Java code: the IDE/compiler
         implementation; lex/yacc specification file along with any C code
         necessary to support the command-line compiler, and
         any other source files necessary for compilation).</li>
     <li>a <tt>Makefile</tt> must be provided that compiles (properly)
         everything required for the assignment when <tt>make all</tt> is
         executed</li>
    <li><b>NOTE</b>: The required <tt>README</tt> file containing instructions
        and notes for the marker is to be integrated into your GUI in the Help
        menu (see above).  See
        <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#submissions">assignment guidelines</a>
         for details regarding this file.</li>
    <li>Any additional files required by the above</li>
    </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Use of Repository:
     <ul>
     <li> Students are <u>required</u> to use the course-provided Git
          repository for revision control management during development.  There
          will be mark deductions for failure to make use of this repository
          over time.</li>
     <li> Doing all development first and then importing it all to your
          repository purely for submission defeats the purpose of using
          revision control and is unacceptable.  You must be making use of
          your repository during development.</li>
     </ul></li>
<p>
</p><li> Apply release tag for submission:
     <ul>
     <li> The source code and documentation making up your submission should be
          tagged appropriately in your Git repository prior to the due
          time, as described in the
          <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dmccaugh/teaching/CIS2750/Assignments/assignments.html#submissions">submission guidelines</a>
          for the course.</li>
